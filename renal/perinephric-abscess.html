      <legend>A 48 year old man presents to the emergency department with a 4 day history of right flank pain and fever
        (38.9°C). He reports a recent cystoscopic removal of a 1.5cm ureteral stone. His past medical history is
        significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus poorly controlled on metformin. On examination, he has tenderness over
        the right costovertebral angle but no palpable mass. Laboratory studies show leukocytosis (WBC=18,500/µL) with
        a left shift and an elevated C-reactive protein of 12mg/dL. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen reveals
        a 5-cm rim-enhancing fluid collection adjacent to the right kidney with mild gas formation within the capsule.
        <br>

      <h2>Answer rationale</h2>  
      The patient has a clinically significant perinephric abscess (>3cm) with gas formation, indicating an anaerobic component. Prompt source control is essential; image-guided percutaneous drainage is the first-line intervention for accessible abscesses and should be combined with appropriate broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (e.g., ceftriaxone + metronidazole). Observation alone or only antibiotic therapy without drainage would delay definitive treatment and increase risk of sepsis. Nephrectomy is reserved for failed drainage, multiloculated abscesses, or concurrent malignancy.
      
      <h1> Perinephric abscess</h1>
        A perinephric abscess is a localized collection of purulent material that forms in the retroperitoneal space surrounding the kidney and renal fascia. It most often results from an untreated or inadequately treated acute pyelonephritis, obstruction by calculi, trauma, or iatrogenic injury (e.g., post-nephrectomy or percutaneous procedures). The clinical picture can mimic a renal neoplasm on imaging, so awareness of its characteristic features and prompt intervention are essential to prevent sepsis and loss of renal function. <br>
        <h3> Pathophysiology</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Initiating Event:</b> A urinary tract infection (UTI) that ascends from the lower urinary tract or an obstruction (e.g., staghorn calculus) creates a nidus for bacterial proliferation.</li>
          <li><b>Bacterial Spread:</b> The bacteria penetrate the renal parenchyma and spread through the perinephric fascia into the retroperitoneal space.</li>
          <li><b>Inflammatory Response:</b> Neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells infiltrate, releasing proteases and cytokines that liquefy tissue and form a purulent cavity.</li>
          <li><b>Abscess Formation:</b> The collection becomes walled off by granulation tissue and fibrous capsule, trapping the pus and preventing further spread.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Epidemiology</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Age:</b> 30-60 years (peak in middle-aged adults)<br></li>
          <li><b>Sex: </b>	Slight male predominance, but females are equally affected when stone disease is common<br></li>
         <li><b>Risk Factors:</b>	Urinary tract obstruction (stones, strictures), diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, recent urologic </li>procedures, chronic kidney disease<br>
        </ul>
        <h3>Clinical presentation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Flank or abdominal pain-</b>	Unilateral, often right-sided; may be constant and deep<br></li>
          <li><b>Fever & chills-</b>	High-grade fever (>38°C) in ~60-80% of cases<br></li>
          <li><b>Costovertebral angle tenderness-</b>	Variable; may be absent if the abscess is large or chronic<br></li>
          <li><b>Weight loss / anorexia-</b>	Seen in subacute/chronic presentations<br></li>
          <li><b>Urinary symptoms-</b>	Dysuria, frequency, hematuria (often mild)<br></li>
          <li><b>Systemic signs-</b>	Malaise, leukocytosis, elevated ESR/CRP<br></li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Laboratory findings</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>CBC: <b>leukocytosis</b> with left shift</li>
          <li>Serum creatinine & BUN: may be mildly elevated if renal function compromised</li>
          <li>Inflammatory markers: <b>ESR ↑, CRP ↑</b></li>
          <li>Urine culture: often yields <i>E. coli, Proteus spp. or Klebsiella</i></li>
          <li>Microbiology: Pus aspiration or drainage can be sent for Gram staining and culture</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Imaging</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Contrast enhanced CT-</b>	Gold standard; shows a <b>rim-enhancing</b> fluid collection adjacent to the kidney, often with gas bubbles if anaerobes are involved. The “rim sign” is highly suggestive of an abscess.</li>
          <li>Ultrasound	May show anechoic or hypoechoic area; limited by bowel gas and depth but useful for bedside evaluation.</li>
          <li>MRI	Useful when CT contrast contraindicated; T1‑hypointense, T2‑hyperintense fluid collection with peripheral enhancement after gadolinium.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Histopathology</h3>
        Foamy macrophages with plasma cells, lymphocytes and giant cells are seen.<br>
        <h3>Complications</h3>
        It can involve nearby organs. It can also lead to secondary amyloidosis and nephrotic syndrome. <br>
        <h3>Management</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Antibiotics targeting common pathogens for the management of pyelonephritis (fluoroquinolone, ceftriaxone).</li>
            <li>Surgical resection of the involved tissue (with total or partial nephrectomy) is the definitive treatment.</li>
        </ol>
