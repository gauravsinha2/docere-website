            <legend>A 56 year old woman presents to your office with complaints of blood in her urine for the last one week. She also complains of back pain on the right side and burning urination. She has not been eating well for the last one month and has also lost some weight. You order routine lab tests and a CT scan suspecting cancer. CT scan shows an enlarged right kidney with multiple low density areas and a staghorn calculus. A biopsy of the lesions reveals lipid laden macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and a few multinucleated cells. What is your diagnosis?</legend>

        <h1> Xanthogranulomaotus Pyelonephritis</h1>
        Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a rare, chronic, and destructive form of pyelonephritis characterized by granulomatous inflammation and accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages, typically associated with long-standing urinary tract obstruction or infection. The kidney is usually enlarged and it may resemble a tumor. <br>
        <h3> Pathophysiology</h3>
        Chronic urinary obstruction (commonly due to calculi) leads to persistent infection by urea-splitting organisms such as <i>Proteus</i> or <i>E. coli</i>. The ongoing inflammatory response recruits macrophages that ingest lipid debris, forming foamy (xanthomatous) macrophages. Over time, normal renal parenchyma is destroyed and replaced by granulomatous tissue.<br>
        <h3>Epidemiology</h3>
        It is seen in women more than men. The typical age of presentation is around 45-55 years. Although less common, it can also be seen in children and the elderly where a gender predominance is not well established. <br>
        <h3>Clinical presentation</h3>
        It is almost always unilateral and generally presents as a chronic unilateral infection with non specific symptoms. The most commonly reported symptoms are flank pain, fever, malaise, lower urinary tract symptoms, anorexia and weight loss. Symptoms are generally present for long durations. Urine culture can isolate enterobacteria like <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>. <br>
        <h3>Imaging</h3>
        A staghorn calculus may be seen. The kidneys are enlarged with dilated calyces and a multiloculated appearance (Bear&apos;s paw sign).<br>
        <h3>Histopathology</h3>
        Foamy macrophages with plasma cells, lymphocytes and giant cells are seen.<br>
        <h3>Complications</h3>
        It can involve nearby organs. It can also lead to secondary amyloidosis and nephrotic syndrome. <br>
        <h3>Management</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Antibiotics targeting common pathogens for the management of pyelonephritis (fluoroquinolone, ceftriaxone).</li>
            <li>Surgical resection of the involved tissue (with total or partial nephrectomy) is the definitive treatment.</li>
        </ol>
